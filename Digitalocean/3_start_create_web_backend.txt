createa Python file for our web backend, which we will call imgrec_webapp.py(using nano like we did earlier). 
We will then have two folders, one to store the uploaded images (which we will call uploads) and one to store the HTML 
files for your frontend (called templates). To create a folder, type mkdir folder_name into the console, where “folder_name” 
can be replaced by your desired name. So the two commands to type are:

mkdir uploads
mkdir templates

Now, we need to upload our model, my_cifar10_model.h5 into the server. Since the model is in my local computer, unfortunately, we can’t use 
the console to upload the model from my desktop. Instead, we will use Windows PowerShell. This is an app that you likely have installed already 
if you are using Windows. If you are on mac (which I am), use the following:

brew install --cask powershell
pwsh

scp  /Users/lockiemichalski/Downloads/my_cifar10_model.h5 root@:~
